## Scientific and Technical Journey of the project :book:
My approach to project construction is based on a gradual increase in the complexity of the solution and the tasks performed. First of all, a simple and classic data science project framework was set up for the repo. As far as the GUI is concerned, I decided to make a small streamlit application, since developing a sophisticated interface is absolutely not the primary objective of this project. A first text generation LLM (DistilGPT2) was first used to run the bot. Then I looked at the fine-tuning of such an LLM, and to make it interesting, I chose to train it on a French text generation dataset in order to make it change language. Once this introduction was done, I had to go further on the conversational capabilities of the LLM used.

So the second step was to focus on the conversational aspect. To do this, I had two main options: I could use a model specialized in conversation directly, and work on making it more specialized, or I could stick with a text generation model and build the right environment for its proper use in a chatbot. I'm currently exploring these two approaches with dialoGPT for the conversational network and GPT2 for the text generation LLM, which gives me greater freedom.
I will probably focus my time finetuning a DialoGPT on a french corpus first, by building a specific tokenizer if it's needed and then performe the training. This part have been implemented but i am facing hardware and memory difficulties for now in order to run the full transfer learing experiment, training is about to be perform on a T4 soon. I am also aware that RAG technics could be interesting in this use case to avoid costly fine-tuning.

## Last Updates :tada:
- [2024.02.18] DialoGPT french custom tokenizer and finetuning code
- [2024.02.18] DialoGPT is now used fot the chatbot
- [2024.02.17] Fine Tuning code for DistilGPT2 on french open dataset
- [2024.02.17] Chatbot IHM with StreamLit v.1
- [2024.02.16] Setup the project & text-generation llm running (Distilgpt2)

## Next Updates :wrench:
- DialoGPT finetining on an open french dataset [Currently working on that]
- Build a custom dataset on sports content
- Fine-tuning on a custom dataset about sports content
- Git CI/CD and Hugging Face Hub Delivery
- Replace dialoGPT by a common text-generation LLM in order to have more flexibility
